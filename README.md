Renderer
================

ATP Renderer is one component for [Atlas Protocol](http://atlasp.io/), which renders TIE (Targeting Interactive Element) to universal terminals.

This library is for iOS devices.

#### Installation Guide

You want to add `pod 'Renderer', '~> 1.1.1'` similar to the following to your Podfile:

```
target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'Renderer', '~> 1.1.1'
end
```

Then run a `pod install` inside your terminal, or from CocoaPods.app.

Alternatively to give it a test run, run the command:

`pod try Renderer`
